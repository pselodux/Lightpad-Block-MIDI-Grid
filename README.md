# 5x5 MIDI Grid

### Description
Simple decoupled 5x5 MIDI grid interface for Roli Lightpad Block.

### Usage
The Lightpad is divided up into 5x5 squares. Each square sends a MIDI note between 36 and 60 when pressed. The same MIDI notes sent to the block will light the corresponding square, with velocity changing the brightness.

As it is decoupled, it can be used as a kind of Monome Grid clone.
